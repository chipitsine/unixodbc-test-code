README
---------------------------------------------------------------

An AutoTest is a library containing one or more Test Cases 
implemented according to the ODBC Test specifications. The test 
libraries are managed and the tests executed by a GUI. The 
unixODBC-GUI-Qt project contains a program called ODBCTestQ4 for 
this purpose. The odbctst32.exe may also be used on MS platforms.

This directory contains collections of Auto Test libraries. The 
Examples collection offers a good place to look for those 
interested in how to write an Auto Test.

Folks (commercial organizations in particular) are encouraged
to contribute additional tests to this project - even if the 
tests are vendor specific.
